Project Name: GAMEKEEPER
Live link: https://game-keeper-96.netlify.app/
 purpose: There are many games in one collection, so you don't have to search for them separately.

 Features: You can open an account with your email or Gmail and see the details of various games. The top 3 games with high ratings will be shown on the home page and to see the rest of the games, you have to go to the games page. There is a nice newsletter below where you can subscribe and get the next updates.
